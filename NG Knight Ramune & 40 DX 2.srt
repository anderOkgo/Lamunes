3
00:00:05,008 --> 00:00:09,525
Hello, I'm the brave Lamunes in trouble again...

4
00:00:09,525 --> 00:00:16,409
In the Hara Hara world, the Gold and Silver Mountain sisters
ask for help from powerful warriors.

5
00:00:16,409 --> 00:00:22,127
Da Cider and I are traveling
to the Puff Puff palace in the Ura Ura valley.

6
00:00:22,127 --> 00:00:27,769
However, besides us,
a number of challenging warriors have appeared.

7
00:00:27,769 --> 00:00:29,458
What will happen?

8
00:00:29,458 --> 00:00:34,981
Even more, a trio of mysterious and cute warriors
appeared and exposed our weaknesses.

9
00:00:34,981 --> 00:00:37,064
This journey has become a mess.

10
00:00:37,064 --> 00:00:39,776
I hope everything turns out fine!

11
00:00:39,776 --> 00:00:45,653
Gold-Chan, Silver-Chan, wait for me.

12
00:00:45,653 --> 00:00:50,371
I'm feeling so excited!

13
00:00:50,371 --> 00:00:52,905
When will you stop doing that?

14
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:11,145
NG Knight Ramune and 40 DX

15
00:01:12,425 --> 00:01:15,527
Saying goodbye is difficult after all.

16
00:01:15,527 --> 00:01:18,650
A smile is the best thing you can give!

17
00:01:18,650 --> 00:01:21,681
Don't let it affect you.

18
00:01:21,681 --> 00:01:24,047
I will keep moving forward.

19
00:01:24,047 --> 00:01:30,228
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

20
00:01:30,228 --> 00:01:33,533
The path of solitude.

21
00:01:33,533 --> 00:01:37,214
It's the destiny of the hero.

22
00:01:37,214 --> 00:01:40,320
Welcome, high school girls (high school girls!)

23
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:43,458
Welcome, college girls (college girls!)

24
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:46,429
To the East, West, North, South, right and left! (let's go!)

25
00:01:46,429 --> 00:01:51,202
Please wait for my arrival.

26
00:02:06,629 --> 00:02:09,733
If this world is a big game,

27
00:02:09,733 --> 00:02:12,844
I promise you a happy ending.

28
00:02:12,844 --> 00:02:15,912
If your level is low,

29
00:02:15,912 --> 00:02:18,264
Don't worry about it.

30
00:02:18,264 --> 00:02:24,207
The romance of our previous life wasn't bad either.

31
00:02:24,207 --> 00:02:27,800
One life at a time,

32
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:31,392
Or they'll keep accumulating.

33
00:02:31,392 --> 00:02:34,484
You look impressive, my lady (my lady!)

34
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:37,542
Like a office lady too (OL too!)

35
00:02:37,542 --> 00:02:40,661
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, even Friday (even Friday!)

36
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:45,958
I will fight 24 hours.

37
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:16,297
Beware of the double reserve! (be careful!)

38
00:03:16,297 --> 00:03:19,387
If you fail, I'll see my blood run (I'll see blood!)

39
00:03:19,387 --> 00:03:22,566
To the East, West, North, South, right and left! (Let's win!)

40
00:03:22,566 --> 00:03:29,226
My youth is my sin.

41
00:03:54,214 --> 00:03:59,760
Exciting space-time, fiery battle.
Warriors of love from the past.

42
00:04:00,657 --> 00:04:03,247
Miruku, Cocoa

43
00:04:03,247 --> 00:04:06,099
Darling, Leska

44
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:09,235
Where is everyone? da-mya.

45
00:04:09,235 --> 00:04:10,917
Hebi.

46
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:22,048
Tomb to the tombs!

47
00:04:22,253 --> 00:04:23,724
What?

48
00:04:25,776 --> 00:04:27,776
What are you up to?

49
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:32,236
Hurry up and do something, Da Cider.

50
00:04:32,482 --> 00:04:34,001
Wake up.

51
00:04:36,834 --> 00:04:38,064
What's wrong with you?

52
00:04:38,343 --> 00:04:43,009
You're doing all this
because Don Harumage brainwashed you.

53
00:04:43,009 --> 00:04:47,869
Wait a minute, I don't remember doing that.

54
00:04:47,869 --> 00:04:50,103
More and more of that, more.

55
00:04:50,103 --> 00:04:52,449
That's my motto (mottoda)

56
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:59,877
See, you're the only one making such stupid puns.

57
00:04:59,877 --> 00:05:00,943
Don't get carried away.

58
00:05:07,329 --> 00:05:09,196
Da Cider, why are you doing this?

59
00:05:09,196 --> 00:05:10,131
What?!

60
00:05:12,316 --> 00:05:17,100
Lamunes, you can't distinguish my self from my other self.

61
00:05:18,757 --> 00:05:21,544
More, destroy more.

62
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:35,933
It's your fault.

63
00:05:39,078 --> 00:05:42,197
Stop blaming me, I don't know what's happening either.

64
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:43,712
Yahooo.

65
00:05:45,216 --> 00:05:48,953
I've found you, Lamunes. - Good to see you, Da Cider.

66
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,081
Where did they come from?

67
00:05:52,728 --> 00:05:54,614
Wait. - Don't go.

68
00:06:02,974 --> 00:06:04,190
Wait.

69
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:05,655
Hey! Lamunes, this way.

70
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:15,520
Oh! They went that way.

71
00:06:18,139 --> 00:06:20,104
By the way, where are we?

72
00:06:28,619 --> 00:06:29,779
King Squasher.

73
00:06:37,316 --> 00:06:39,454
What are you doing?

74
00:06:39,454 --> 00:06:42,346
I told you I don't know, idiot!

75
00:06:42,346 --> 00:06:43,242
What?

76
00:06:44,076 --> 00:06:47,812
Miruku, don't you think this situation is strange?

77
00:06:47,812 --> 00:06:51,835
I can't think about that now,
I must focus on hitting them.

78
00:06:51,835 --> 00:06:53,646
Well said.
- But...

79
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:56,560
Are we time traveling?
- Yes.

80
00:06:59,129 --> 00:07:01,362
The collision of the rocks caused an explosion in the cave

81
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:03,422
And we've fallen into the Hara Hara world from three years ago.

82
00:07:03,422 --> 00:07:07,880
In other words, we're now in a different time.

83
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,604
But how did you reach that conclusion?

84
00:07:10,604 --> 00:07:12,456
Your head's going to explode.

85
00:07:12,456 --> 00:07:16,239
Can't you acknowledge I'm right without disrespecting me?

86
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:28,611
So, how do we return to the original time?

87
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,219
With an explosion.

88
00:07:30,219 --> 00:07:33,277
If we get caught in an explosion like last time.

89
00:07:33,277 --> 00:07:34,946
Something like this.

90
00:07:34,946 --> 00:07:35,637
What?

91
00:07:36,339 --> 00:07:41,100
The solution.
(Note: a play on words between rubbing, butt, and solution).

92
00:07:41,230 --> 00:07:43,344
I can't keep relying on him.

93
00:07:43,582 --> 00:07:49,415
Come on, Lamunes, we can't let King Squasher see us.

94
00:07:51,513 --> 00:07:52,951
Dimensional explosion stone?

95
00:07:52,951 --> 00:07:54,520
What's that?

96
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,453
This is...

97
00:07:56,453 --> 00:08:01,264
If this explodes, we'll time travel.

98
00:08:01,924 --> 00:08:04,282
Why do you have something so dangerous?

99
00:08:04,282 --> 00:08:08,494
Because... it's weird.

100
00:08:12,743 --> 00:08:13,691
Hurry up, Lamunes.

101
00:08:13,691 --> 00:08:14,599
Please wait.

102
00:08:22,722 --> 00:08:25,739
What has happened?

103
00:08:26,959 --> 00:08:29,127
This shouldn't have happened.

104
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,908
And that...

105
00:08:44,894 --> 00:08:47,134
That was dangerous.

106
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:51,844
The danger isn't over yet.

107
00:08:52,587 --> 00:08:58,656
Miruki Sword, action.

108
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,212
And now where are we?

109
00:09:34,243 --> 00:09:36,334
That's the Star Ship.
(Note: they have fallen to chapter 11 of the first season.)

110
00:09:36,334 --> 00:09:37,984
Oh, just what we needed.

111
00:09:37,984 --> 00:09:39,962
Great! Let's ride that thing.

112
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:42,879
Yahoo!

113
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:43,669
What?

114
00:09:43,669 --> 00:09:45,397
Is no one here?

115
00:09:45,397 --> 00:09:47,457
What?

116
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:51,783
They're the 8 Pawn siblings.

117
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,295
What's wrong with the Pawn siblings?

118
00:10:07,451 --> 00:10:10,810
Hey, Lamunes, make them stop.

119
00:10:15,569 --> 00:10:18,572
So, how do we get back?

120
00:10:18,572 --> 00:10:21,522
I've tried to investigate,
but the components of these rocks are unknown.

121
00:10:21,522 --> 00:10:27,544
One of these rocks will take us to the present.

122
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:28,968
Which one is it?

123
00:10:28,968 --> 00:10:30,490
I don't know.

124
00:10:32,033 --> 00:10:34,695
If we explode them one by one?

125
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:42,852
We might get trapped in the time-space forever.

126
00:10:45,241 --> 00:10:46,857
Wait a moment.

127
00:10:51,378 --> 00:10:53,802
Miruku, I know

128
00:10:53,802 --> 00:10:57,749
They haven't received their punishment yet.

129
00:10:57,749 --> 00:11:01,579
Then, let's leave returning to the present for later.

130
00:11:01,579 --> 00:11:04,734
Let's do the Cocoa transformation.

131
00:11:06,637 --> 00:11:09,743
Seinaru Milky Power.

132
00:11:09,743 --> 00:11:12,587
Seinaru Lemon Power.

133
00:11:12,587 --> 00:11:15,526
Seinaru Cacao Power.

134
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:18,656
Transformation. —Transformation

135
00:11:25,047 --> 00:11:26,778
Hurry up.

136
00:11:26,778 --> 00:11:28,069
Don't look at me.

137
00:11:28,783 --> 00:11:33,821
I am a royal warrior who fights
for love and justice, Seinaru Miruki.

138
00:11:33,821 --> 00:11:36,801
And I am Seinaru Lemon.

139
00:11:36,801 --> 00:11:40,247
I am Cacao.

140
00:11:40,247 --> 00:11:42,845
Lamunes —Da Cider.

141
00:11:42,845 --> 00:11:45,732
We will punish them.

142
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,488
They're not here anymore.

143
00:11:55,407 --> 00:11:57,068
What's wrong with these guys?

144
00:11:57,068 --> 00:11:58,724
Oh, I remember now.

145
00:11:58,724 --> 00:12:01,431
We're in the port city.

146
00:12:01,431 --> 00:12:04,482
Oh, I remember, this is where
we met Mart Ross.

147
00:12:04,482 --> 00:12:06,445
People used to fight in the streets over that drink.

148
00:12:06,445 --> 00:12:07,559
We found them.

149
00:12:07,559 --> 00:12:11,199
Don't move.

150
00:12:11,199 --> 00:12:12,560
Let's flee.

151
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,724
Just in time.

152
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:24,493
Lamunes, it's not time to celebrate.

153
00:12:24,493 --> 00:12:26,674
Right, wait.

154
00:12:29,053 --> 00:12:30,452
Sorry.

155
00:12:31,244 --> 00:12:32,678
Wait.

156
00:12:33,874 --> 00:12:35,804
My glasses.

157
00:12:35,804 --> 00:12:37,029
Here...

158
00:12:38,186 --> 00:12:39,896
Thank you.

159
00:12:40,611 --> 00:12:44,929
Oh, you're so kind, sister.

160
00:12:44,929 --> 00:12:48,613
Oh, how sweet you are.

161
00:12:48,613 --> 00:12:51,734
Wearing glasses is such a shame, don't you think?

162
00:12:52,461 --> 00:12:56,368
Excuse me, I'm in a hurry.

163
00:12:56,368 --> 00:12:59,290
Yes, see you another time.

164
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:02,152
Yes, take care.

165
00:13:09,450 --> 00:13:11,357
It's time for...

166
00:13:11,357 --> 00:13:12,573
—You to give up.

167
00:13:12,573 --> 00:13:16,757
You need time to make me surrender.

168
00:13:16,757 --> 00:13:20,242
Toki (time) says to give up.

169
00:13:21,098 --> 00:13:22,943
I thought of something too.

170
00:13:22,943 --> 00:13:27,942
You realize something stupid
after doing something stupid!

171
00:13:29,463 --> 00:13:31,269
What is this?

172
00:13:31,269 --> 00:13:33,163
Oh, Da Cider.

173
00:13:33,163 --> 00:13:35,895
These are the explosion rocks that threw us through time-space.

174
00:13:35,895 --> 00:13:36,740
What?

175
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:40,308
I see...
(Note: they have traveled to chapter 16 of the first season.)

176
00:13:40,308 --> 00:13:42,676
Soy sauce.

177
00:13:42,676 --> 00:13:44,407
Guys.

178
00:13:44,407 --> 00:13:47,005
You wouldn't dare?

179
00:13:47,005 --> 00:13:49,110
We might!

180
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:50,199
Don't do it.

181
00:13:50,199 --> 00:13:52,890
You know well what will happen to you if you do.

182
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:55,164
How foolish.

183
00:13:55,164 --> 00:13:58,645
These girls think they know us well, Lamunes.

184
00:13:58,645 --> 00:14:01,168
But there's something they don't know.

185
00:14:01,168 --> 00:14:02,535
What?

186
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:06,884
That's right, you don't know how Miruku gets.

187
00:14:06,884 --> 00:14:08,504
Leska too.

188
00:14:08,504 --> 00:14:09,811
What do you mean?

189
00:14:10,579 --> 00:14:12,848
We're not afraid of any consequences.

190
00:14:12,848 --> 00:14:15,127
That's why we act without thinking.

191
00:14:15,127 --> 00:14:18,260
That's right, I even started to enjoy the fights.

192
00:14:19,229 --> 00:14:22,984
This is a testimony from two brave Warriors.

193
00:14:22,984 --> 00:14:25,795
Do it, Da Cider.

194
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:38,367
This place...
(Note: they have traveled to chapter 16 of the first season.)

195
00:14:38,367 --> 00:14:41,614
Yes, this is the great floating tree in the forest.

196
00:14:41,614 --> 00:14:45,148
beppin should be somewhere

197
00:14:46,374 --> 00:14:48,939
I'm hungry.

198
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,102
You sound like a little girl.

199
00:14:51,889 --> 00:14:53,877
Yoo...

200
00:14:53,877 --> 00:14:55,548
Oh, oh.

201
00:14:57,149 --> 00:15:00,607
I just have to wait for them to arrive.

202
00:15:02,734 --> 00:15:04,600
Yahoo.

203
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,668
What are you all doing here?

204
00:15:06,668 --> 00:15:08,003
It's been a long time...

205
00:15:08,003 --> 00:15:09,369
Leska, how did you get here so quickly?

206
00:15:09,369 --> 00:15:13,503
We're chasing Lamunes and his partner.

207
00:15:13,503 --> 00:15:14,398
What?

208
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:19,829
This can't be, but on the monitor...

209
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:25,767
I'm sorry, could you give us something to eat?

210
00:15:25,767 --> 00:15:26,760
Huh?

211
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,681
Come on, we're old friends.

212
00:15:29,681 --> 00:15:34,456
No problem... You look a bit older.

213
00:15:34,456 --> 00:15:35,353
Leave me alone.

214
00:15:36,202 --> 00:15:37,871
Where are we?

215
00:15:37,871 --> 00:15:41,449
Well, I've seen this scene somewhere before.

216
00:15:41,449 --> 00:15:50,243
I bought an FD BOX for cases like these,
I think I have it stored here.

217
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:52,081
Alright, but...

218
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,364
Aren't you hungry?

219
00:15:53,364 --> 00:15:55,398
Now that you mention it, I'm feeling hungry... (hetta naa)

220
00:15:55,398 --> 00:15:58,482
Head head, double head.

221
00:15:58,482 --> 00:15:59,407
Again with the same thing.

222
00:15:59,407 --> 00:16:02,470
Oh, we have a lot of apples here.

223
00:16:12,877 --> 00:16:15,807
Why are you dressed like that?

224
00:16:15,807 --> 00:16:18,755
You look like you're going to a comic convention!

225
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:23,760
Aren't you too old for that?

226
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:26,543
How sad that you have to resort to this to appear young.

227
00:16:26,543 --> 00:16:29,458
Soon you'll have wrinkles.

228
00:16:29,458 --> 00:16:31,884
Are you looking for a fight?

229
00:16:31,884 --> 00:16:34,575
I've eaten well.

230
00:16:34,575 --> 00:16:41,484
Sister, remember why we came here.

231
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:42,930
I know.

232
00:16:42,930 --> 00:16:44,241
Sister?

233
00:16:44,241 --> 00:16:49,894
Ah, we've been separated for a long time
but they are my sisters.

234
00:16:49,894 --> 00:16:52,462
We're after Lamunes and his partner.

235
00:16:52,462 --> 00:16:54,328
Thank you for the food.

236
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:57,584
Come on, let's go.

237
00:16:57,584 --> 00:16:59,776
Where are you going?

238
00:17:04,443 --> 00:17:05,476
What?

239
00:17:07,715 --> 00:17:09,897
What is that idiot doing?

240
00:17:09,897 --> 00:17:14,429
Leska, your friend has changed.

241
00:17:15,594 --> 00:17:19,783
I don't know what you're talking about, what was that?

242
00:17:19,783 --> 00:17:25,537
But if... that was Da Cider, sister.

243
00:17:25,537 --> 00:17:27,045
Idiot.

244
00:17:27,045 --> 00:17:29,877
So that was your beloved Da Cider.

245
00:17:29,877 --> 00:17:33,265
You sure have bad taste.

246
00:17:33,265 --> 00:17:36,124
No, it's a misunderstanding.

247
00:17:36,124 --> 00:17:38,034
How strange.

248
00:17:38,034 --> 00:17:41,544
That face, that personality, and those unpleasant phrases

249
00:17:41,544 --> 00:17:45,347
As well as his pumpkin head, how can you not love that man...

250
00:17:45,347 --> 00:17:46,815
What?

251
00:17:46,815 --> 00:17:52,219
I was wondering, which of his qualities attracted you the most?

252
00:17:52,219 --> 00:17:56,897
Stop bothering, you're the least qualified to talk about men.

253
00:17:56,897 --> 00:18:01,817
Well, love has affected you, unbelievable.

254
00:18:04,646 --> 00:18:07,883
You've made me angry, you're dead.

255
00:18:07,883 --> 00:18:10,474
How funny, try it.

256
00:18:22,622 --> 00:18:25,265
There are many princesses gathered here.

257
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:29,299
What a shame.

258
00:18:29,299 --> 00:18:37,419
Both have been eating mulberries and turned into fairy tale characters.

259
00:18:37,969 --> 00:18:42,374
Let's dance with the princesses.

260
00:18:45,504 --> 00:18:49,607
This is the most suitable boyfriend for you.

261
00:18:49,607 --> 00:18:53,301
Cocoa, how can we return these two to their original state?

262
00:18:55,163 --> 00:19:01,792
If they eat the "original" fruit that looks like blue apples, it's at the top of the tree.

263
00:19:04,404 --> 00:19:06,043
Let's dance!

264
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:10,221
Pair of fools.

265
00:19:10,221 --> 00:19:12,680
Don't be embarrassed anymore.

266
00:19:30,770 --> 00:19:33,062
What were we doing?

267
00:19:33,062 --> 00:19:37,809
What a strange dream I had for listening to you and eating that.

268
00:19:38,383 --> 00:19:41,890
Idiot, what are you basing that on to blame me.

269
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:42,800
What are you saying?

270
00:19:45,803 --> 00:19:50,474
Even if they return to normal, they behave the same way.

271
00:19:55,382 --> 00:20:00,169
I am Gold Mountain. - I am Silver Mountain.

272
00:20:00,169 --> 00:20:02,061
Da Cider. - Lamunes.

273
00:20:02,989 --> 00:20:04,976
This is not the time to fight.

274
00:20:04,976 --> 00:20:08,206
We have a great mission.

275
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,397
Now we need to return to the present.

276
00:20:11,397 --> 00:20:14,359
Let's go back.

277
00:20:20,946 --> 00:20:22,445
Damn it.

278
00:20:23,853 --> 00:20:26,609
That was strange.

279
00:20:27,327 --> 00:20:29,239
At least those two are there.

280
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:35,970
I won't forgive them.

281
00:20:51,587 --> 00:20:52,946
Where are we? - Here they are.
(Note: Chapter 36.)

282
00:20:59,678 --> 00:21:01,136
Damn it.

283
00:21:02,369 --> 00:21:04,991
Oh, it can't be.

284
00:21:05,673 --> 00:21:09,409
This way we'll never be able to go back.

285
00:21:32,896 --> 00:21:34,191
Those are...

286
00:21:35,453 --> 00:21:37,135
Missiles. - Missiles.

287
00:21:47,529 --> 00:21:49,176
What was all that?

288
00:21:49,176 --> 00:21:50,619
Where are we?

289
00:21:51,736 --> 00:21:52,736
Are you alright?

290
00:21:56,155 --> 00:21:58,136
They don't seem to be hurt.

291
00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:03,356
Dammit. Involving innocent people in battle.

292
00:22:03,356 --> 00:22:05,307
I'll never forgive them. Syder.

293
00:22:05,307 --> 00:22:06,869
I agree. Ramune.

294
00:22:07,408 --> 00:22:13,151
I'm feeling very furious now.

295
00:22:13,151 --> 00:22:15,957
Ah, he looks like Lamunes.

296
00:22:15,957 --> 00:22:17,987
What's going on?

297
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:22,075
They are the first Legendary warriors.

298
00:22:23,814 --> 00:22:27,185
But that was a long time ago, right?

299
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:32,973
Well, about 5000 years ago.

300
00:22:57,237 --> 00:22:59,918
Please stay here.

301
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,454
You need to stay away from me.

302
00:23:06,352 --> 00:23:07,819
I'm fine.

303
00:23:07,819 --> 00:23:10,586
Please, heroes, can we go with you?

304
00:23:10,586 --> 00:23:11,978
We cannot allow it.

305
00:23:11,978 --> 00:23:16,185
We don't want to get involved in the fight.

306
00:23:16,941 --> 00:23:21,424
We've been traveling with three women.

307
00:23:21,424 --> 00:23:24,824
But now they are in the hands of the enemy, in that castle.

308
00:23:24,824 --> 00:23:27,011
It's all our fault!

309
00:23:27,011 --> 00:23:31,193
We brought them to this dangerous place.

310
00:23:31,193 --> 00:23:35,538
I wish those two would behave like true heroes.

311
00:23:35,538 --> 00:23:36,635
You're right.

312
00:23:38,789 --> 00:23:41,488
We fell into a dangerous place.

313
00:23:41,488 --> 00:23:44,223
I don't recognize this place.

314
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,506
This is the Ura Ura Valley!

315
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:48,959
We finally arrived.

316
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:52,556
Let's hurry to get to the Puff Puff Palace.

317
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,870
If they're here, we can't do anything.

318
00:23:59,585 --> 00:24:01,573
Can we help you with something?

319
00:24:01,573 --> 00:24:05,199
Don't worry, we'll take care of the rest!

320
00:24:05,199 --> 00:24:06,719
Of course.

321
00:24:06,719 --> 00:24:09,714
Aren't they wonderful?

322
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:11,826
Come on, Syder.

323
00:24:11,826 --> 00:24:14,354
We need to rescue Miruku and the girls.

324
00:24:14,354 --> 00:24:15,039
Yes.

325
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:17,442
Ramune.

326
00:24:17,442 --> 00:24:24,030
You, what do you feel for Miss Miruku?

327
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:26,154
Of course I love her.

328
00:24:27,575 --> 00:24:33,628
Mr. Syder, do you also love Miss Cafeore?

329
00:24:37,014 --> 00:24:39,156
So, take care.

330
00:24:42,119 --> 00:24:43,517
They're wonderful.

331
00:24:43,517 --> 00:24:47,276
Why weren't we born in this era?

332
00:24:47,276 --> 00:24:52,442
We're forgetting our original purpose.

333
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,222
Those two.

334
00:24:55,222 --> 00:24:59,063
Da Cider, the Puff Puff Palace
looks more like a castle.

335
00:24:59,063 --> 00:25:01,301
We definitely have to go.

336
00:25:01,301 --> 00:25:06,408
Gold-Chan, wait for me. - Silver-Chan, I'm coming.

337
00:25:07,643 --> 00:25:10,262
Wait there.

338
00:25:11,467 --> 00:25:13,503
We can't forgive...

339
00:25:13,503 --> 00:25:15,990
Men who trample on women's feelings.

340
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,318
We will punish them in the name of love and justice.

341
00:25:17,318 --> 00:25:19,511
The warrior princesses

342
00:25:19,511 --> 00:25:21,531
Are here.

343
00:25:22,113 --> 00:25:24,302
Have they been there all this time?

344
00:25:24,909 --> 00:25:26,366
Shut up.

345
00:25:27,085 --> 00:25:29,085
We'll punish them.

346
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:30,505
Time to escape.

347
00:25:30,847 --> 00:25:32,442
Wait.

348
00:25:34,257 --> 00:25:36,765
I'll be the first to reach the Puff Puff Palace.

349
00:25:36,765 --> 00:25:39,161
Don't even think about it.

350
00:25:41,488 --> 00:25:43,857
You guys. - Wait.

351
00:25:49,887 --> 00:25:54,322
Da Cider, are those Kings Squasher and Queen Sideron?

352
00:25:54,322 --> 00:25:57,779
Still not back to the present?

353
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:02,214
Don't forget about us!

354
00:26:02,214 --> 00:26:04,334
Where do you think you're going!

355
00:26:09,808 --> 00:26:12,220
Oh, wait.

356
00:26:29,308 --> 00:26:31,565
Wow, what a surprise.

357
00:26:31,565 --> 00:26:36,675
Miruku, Cocoa. - Sister Leska, you're alive.

358
00:26:38,241 --> 00:26:39,269
Who's there, da-mya?

359
00:26:39,269 --> 00:26:41,973
We sensed the presence of a sacred power.

360
00:26:41,973 --> 00:26:44,930
What good luck.

361
00:26:44,930 --> 00:26:48,577
We've encountered the three sacred sisters.

362
00:26:55,126 --> 00:26:58,276
Where are we? Have we returned to the present?

363
00:26:58,276 --> 00:26:59,992
Oh! Da Cider.

364
00:26:59,992 --> 00:27:01,097
What?

365
00:27:01,863 --> 00:27:03,773
Puff Puff Palace.

366
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,663
Da Cider.

367
00:27:05,663 --> 00:27:08,875
Well, this time seems to be the right one.

368
00:27:08,875 --> 00:27:10,062
Let's go.

369
00:27:10,062 --> 00:27:13,428
Yaho, yaho, la, la, yaho la, la.

370
00:27:17,505 --> 00:27:20,566
The same thing happened 5000 years ago.

371
00:27:20,566 --> 00:27:24,579
But sister, this time the purpose is different.

372
00:27:24,579 --> 00:27:26,789
That's right.

373
00:27:26,789 --> 00:27:31,094
We're going to use the power of the three sacred sisters.

374
00:27:32,915 --> 00:27:35,669
To increase our strength.

375
00:27:35,669 --> 00:27:39,285
And conquer the Doki Doki Space.

376
00:27:44,484 --> 00:27:47,276
Yaho, yaho, la, la, yaho la, la.

377
00:27:53,829 --> 00:27:56,456
Yaho, la, la...

378
00:27:57,114 --> 00:28:05,150

NG Knight Ramune and 40 DX Ending 1 V2
Lullaby ☆ My Dear.

380
00:28:19,661 --> 00:28:27,430
Why are my breasts peach-colored?

381
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:34,644
Why is your hand bigger? Why?

382
00:28:34,644 --> 00:28:42,167
Coincidentally, both sizes fit perfectly.

383
00:28:42,167 --> 00:28:54,299
Like a natural scent that overlays any perfume.

384
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:58,138
GOOD NIGHT, my heart.

385
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:02,493
GOOD NIGHT, Good night.

386
00:29:02,493 --> 00:29:09,683
Like a lullaby whisper (Lullaby)

387
00:29:09,683 --> 00:29:13,507
GOOD NIGHT, before falling asleep.

388
00:29:13,507 --> 00:29:17,943
GOOD NIGHT, if you dream.

389
00:29:17,943 --> 00:29:26,822
And so the ecstasy will feel, ah, ah...

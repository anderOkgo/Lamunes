Unreleased version from the year 2023.

00:00:14,347 --> 00:00:19,301
NG Knight Ramune and 40 DX

4
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:23,522
Saying goodbye is difficult after all

5
00:00:23,522 --> 00:00:26,645
A smile is the best thing you can give!

6
00:00:26,645 --> 00:00:29,676
Don't let it get to you.

7
00:00:29,676 --> 00:00:32,042
I will keep moving forward.

8
00:00:32,042 --> 00:00:38,223
I don't know what tomorrow will be like.

9
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:41,528
The path of solitude

10
00:00:41,528 --> 00:00:45,209
Is the destiny of the hero.

11
00:00:45,209 --> 00:00:48,315
Welcome high school girls (high school girls!)

12
00:00:48,315 --> 00:00:51,453
Welcome college girls (college girls!)

13
00:00:51,453 --> 00:00:54,424
To the East, West, North, South, right, and left! (let's go!)

14
00:00:54,424 --> 00:00:59,197
Please wait for my arrival.

15
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:17,728
If this world is a great game

16
00:01:17,728 --> 00:01:20,839
I promise you a happy ending.

17
00:01:20,839 --> 00:01:23,907
If your level is low

18
00:01:23,907 --> 00:01:26,259
Don't worry about it.

19
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:32,202
The romance of our previous life wasn't bad either

20
00:01:32,202 --> 00:01:35,795
One life at a time

21
00:01:35,795 --> 00:01:39,387
Or they will accumulate.

22
00:01:39,387 --> 00:01:42,479
You shine brightly, my lady (my lady!)

23
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,537
Like a office lady too (OL too!)

24
00:01:45,537 --> 00:01:48,656
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday too, (Friday too!)

25
00:01:48,656 --> 00:01:53,953
I will fight 24 hours.

26
00:02:21,234 --> 00:02:24,292
Be careful with the double reserve! (be careful!)

27
00:02:24,292 --> 00:02:27,382
If you fail, I'll see my blood run (I'll see blood!)

28
00:02:27,382 --> 00:02:30,561
To the East, West, North, South, right, and left! (We're going to win!)

29
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:37,221
My youth is my sin.

30
00:03:24,873 --> 00:03:29,128
We couldn't miss the opportunity to get the three sacred sisters!

31
00:03:29,128 --> 00:03:32,683
This will make things easier for us, sister.

32
00:03:38,452 --> 00:03:40,930
Where am I?

33
00:03:40,930 --> 00:03:43,555
You seem to have a lot of energy.

34
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,805
What is all this about?

35
00:03:45,805 --> 00:03:47,818
What are you doing?

36
00:03:47,818 --> 00:03:52,009
And who are you, and why are you treating us like this?

37
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:58,466
Good morning, did you sleep well?

38
00:03:58,466 --> 00:04:00,703
You are the ones from the crystal ball.

39
00:04:00,703 --> 00:04:02,672
Oh, how do you know?

40
00:04:02,672 --> 00:04:08,678
You looked so defenseless while sleeping, and to think that
you are the three sacred sisters.

41
00:04:08,678 --> 00:04:10,497
How do you know?

42
00:04:10,497 --> 00:04:14,462
Even if you don't know, we have a shared relationship and history.

43
00:04:14,462 --> 00:04:17,284
I don't like how you're saying it.

44
00:04:17,284 --> 00:04:18,975
What are you going to do to us?

45
00:04:18,975 --> 00:04:23,300
You better release us, or you'll pay dearly.

46
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:24,978
We can't do that.

47
00:04:24,978 --> 00:04:29,864
Your power is now part of our plan.

48
00:04:29,864 --> 00:04:31,035
Plan?

49
00:04:31,035 --> 00:04:36,371
Our mission is to make our father's dreams come true.

50
00:04:36,371 --> 00:04:40,850
We will take control of the Doki Doki Space.

51
00:04:43,098 --> 00:04:44,220
That's it!

52
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,416
Don Harumage.

53
00:04:51,012 --> 00:04:56,605
Exciting space-time, fiery battle.
Warriors of love forever.

54
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:12,525
Finally, finally we have arrived.

55
00:05:12,525 --> 00:05:15,954
I'm so excited right now.

56
00:05:15,954 --> 00:05:20,567
When you think about it, it was a tremendous path of difficulties and suffering.

57
00:05:20,567 --> 00:05:24,696
My indomitable spirit can overcome any obstacle.

58
00:05:27,768 --> 00:05:30,955
Gold-Chan, Silver-Chan, I'm coming right now.

59
00:05:30,955 --> 00:05:33,588
I'll give you my entire body.

60
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,792
Here come the brave warriors.

61
00:05:44,792 --> 00:05:50,368
We need to test if they meet
the warrior standard we need.

62
00:05:56,472 --> 00:05:57,639
Lamunes.

63
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:59,454
Da Cider.

64
00:05:59,855 --> 00:06:01,167
You're an idiot.

65
00:06:02,464 --> 00:06:05,432
Look, sister.

66
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:09,475
Do they both seem familiar to me?

67
00:06:09,475 --> 00:06:11,186
Indeed...

68
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,153
Apparently, they are not them.

69
00:06:27,153 --> 00:06:30,677
It seems they are second-rate warriors.

70
00:06:30,677 --> 00:06:32,265
Despicable.

71
00:06:32,265 --> 00:06:33,893
Wretched.

72
00:06:41,096 --> 00:06:44,441
We have to get out of here somehow, mya.

73
00:06:44,441 --> 00:06:46,723
But how?

74
00:06:46,723 --> 00:06:48,486
There's only one way.

75
00:06:48,486 --> 00:06:50,647
And it's like this, mya.

76
00:06:50,647 --> 00:06:52,048
Alright.

77
00:07:07,822 --> 00:07:11,599
So, let's make them put in some effort.

78
00:07:14,734 --> 00:07:15,972
What is this?

79
00:07:26,303 --> 00:07:30,171
I can't stop thinking about them.

80
00:07:30,171 --> 00:07:33,689
Well, these are obstacles to glory.

81
00:07:34,965 --> 00:07:37,621
I'm surprised at how well they're doing.

82
00:07:37,621 --> 00:07:38,915
Great.

83
00:07:39,983 --> 00:07:42,785
Lamunes, what are you doing?

84
00:07:42,785 --> 00:07:45,900
Actually, Da Cider, you're a fool.

85
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:50,316
The goal is near.

86
00:07:50,316 --> 00:07:52,594
One step closer to glory.

87
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,745
Damn you, Lamunes.

88
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,855
Da Cider, don't move.

89
00:08:21,236 --> 00:08:22,288
Lamunes.

90
00:08:22,288 --> 00:08:23,587
Da Cider.

91
00:08:39,739 --> 00:08:42,154
It tickles.

92
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:45,143
If we move, it will be our end.

93
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,270
That butterfly was incredibly ticklish.

94
00:09:05,031 --> 00:09:06,589
Astro yoyo.

95
00:09:24,807 --> 00:09:26,902
We survived this time.

96
00:09:26,902 --> 00:09:28,868
I thought I was going to die.

97
00:09:46,417 --> 00:09:48,857
Where am I?

98
00:09:50,549 --> 00:09:53,931
Mr. Lamunes.

99
00:10:01,228 --> 00:10:03,863
Leska, don't do that in front of others.

100
00:10:05,834 --> 00:10:07,174
Leave that alone, Da Cider.

101
00:10:08,006 --> 00:10:09,481
What are you doing?

102
00:10:09,481 --> 00:10:13,429
I'm tired of you attacking me by surprise.

103
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:20,649
Where are we?

104
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:24,008
That hurts.

105
00:10:24,008 --> 00:10:25,627
This isn't a dream.

106
00:10:25,627 --> 00:10:28,019
Why don't you shave your balls?

107
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,606
Welcome, brave warriors!

108
00:10:34,606 --> 00:10:37,891
You've passed all the tests.

109
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:39,860
I am Gold Mountain.

110
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:42,121
I am Silver Mountain.

111
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:47,010
Fine ladies, I am the famous Lamu...

112
00:10:47,813 --> 00:10:49,934
Beautiful ladies.

113
00:10:49,934 --> 00:10:55,382
This body is tougher than a wall,
I am the brave Da Ci...

114
00:10:55,382 --> 00:10:56,719
You scoundrel! What are you doing?

115
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:57,658
I was here before you.

116
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:58,657
You want to fight?

117
00:10:58,657 --> 00:11:00,609
Let's do it.

118
00:11:02,225 --> 00:11:04,932
You two, stop that fight.

119
00:11:04,932 --> 00:11:06,759
Then, allow us to attend to you.

120
00:11:07,727 --> 00:11:09,657
That's right.

121
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,560
Fighting gets us nowhere...

122
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,643
Why are they behaving like this?
Lamunes is a complete idiot.

123
00:11:20,643 --> 00:11:24,005
Da Cider, you detestable otaku.

124
00:11:35,131 --> 00:11:36,260
How are you?

125
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,147
It's delicious.

126
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,886
Paradise, paradise.

127
00:11:39,886 --> 00:11:43,118
But what can we do for you?

128
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:50,097
Well, leave it all to this glorious body.

129
00:11:50,097 --> 00:11:55,008
Well, you're making noise like a big boat in a mud tank.

130
00:11:55,008 --> 00:11:55,775
What?

131
00:11:55,775 --> 00:11:59,404
Don't argue, please!

132
00:11:59,404 --> 00:12:03,572
Now then, it's time to fulfill your desires...
Don't think about anything else, okay?

133
00:12:06,397 --> 00:12:08,390
Lamunes. —Da Cider.

134
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:10,730
What was that?

135
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,046
Is this a hallucination?

136
00:12:12,046 --> 00:12:13,733
What's going on?

137
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:16,091
No, nothing's wrong.

138
00:12:16,724 --> 00:12:18,171
If we scorn them...

139
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:20,178
—we would be a disgrace.

140
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:23,316
Lamunes, you're a big idiot.

141
00:12:23,316 --> 00:12:26,546
Da Cider, you despicable scoundrel.

142
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:30,345
Miruku, please forgive me, I'm sorry.

143
00:12:30,345 --> 00:12:34,936
Leska, I was wrong, spare my life.

144
00:12:39,997 --> 00:12:41,792
Is this another hallucination?

145
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:46,355
Gold-chan. —Silver-chan.

146
00:12:47,123 --> 00:12:49,378
Don't talk to us with that confidence.

147
00:12:49,378 --> 00:12:55,102
Hey, hey. You guys are the Heroes Lamunes and Da Cider.

148
00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:58,327
Why are they suddenly acting like this?

149
00:12:58,327 --> 00:13:00,518
Suddenly, their attitudes have changed.

150
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,017
It seems like a joke.

151
00:13:02,017 --> 00:13:03,790
What's going on?

152
00:13:03,916 --> 00:13:05,638
Silence. —Silence.

153
00:13:05,638 --> 00:13:08,316
Both of you are enemies of our father.

154
00:13:08,904 --> 00:13:11,181
Enemies of your father?

155
00:13:14,742 --> 00:13:15,302
Wait.

156
00:13:16,143 --> 00:13:17,844
What's happening?

157
00:13:23,878 --> 00:13:25,107
Where are we?

158
00:13:25,107 --> 00:13:26,271
Lamunes.

159
00:13:26,271 --> 00:13:27,480
Da Cider.

160
00:13:30,391 --> 00:13:34,753
Oh! Seinaru Miruki, Seinaru Cacao, Seinaru Lemon.

161
00:13:34,753 --> 00:13:36,956
Why are you in this place?

162
00:13:37,392 --> 00:13:39,695
Lamunes, haven't you realized yet?

163
00:13:42,015 --> 00:13:43,296
It's me.

164
00:13:44,098 --> 00:13:45,853
You are Miruku.

165
00:13:45,853 --> 00:13:49,220
In that case, you must be Leska?

166
00:13:50,245 --> 00:13:51,894
Now you know, you idiot!

167
00:13:51,894 --> 00:13:55,809
So the other one is Cocoa?

168
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:01,789
But why did you do this, Miruku?

169
00:14:01,789 --> 00:14:04,821
Leskar, do you have those hobbies?

170
00:14:04,821 --> 00:14:07,243
Of course not.

171
00:14:07,243 --> 00:14:09,106
We did it to capture them.

172
00:14:09,106 --> 00:14:10,413
Capture us?

173
00:14:10,413 --> 00:14:12,537
Anyway, release us quickly.

174
00:14:12,537 --> 00:14:15,494
Don't even think about it, Lamunes. —Da Cider.

175
00:14:18,305 --> 00:14:21,012
You've fooled us well!

176
00:14:21,012 --> 00:14:26,311
Are you trying to undermine our ambition
by pretending to be warriors we recruited?

177
00:14:26,311 --> 00:14:29,733
I don't know what you're talking about.
—A play on words?

178
00:14:29,733 --> 00:14:34,225
We're ready.

179
00:14:34,225 --> 00:14:36,033
What do you say?

180
00:14:40,269 --> 00:14:42,144
That's Don Harumage.

181
00:14:42,144 --> 00:14:44,184
Who are you?

182
00:14:44,184 --> 00:14:47,030
We are the maidens of the Goburiki sanctuary.

183
00:14:47,030 --> 00:14:49,475
Our mission is to fulfill
the ambitions of our lord Goburiki.

184
00:14:49,475 --> 00:14:54,028
We won't stand for the enemies
of our father Gokuriki!

185
00:14:54,028 --> 00:14:55,645
Priestesses of Goburiki?

186
00:14:55,645 --> 00:14:57,202
Consider us as enemies?

187
00:14:57,202 --> 00:14:59,971
Don't say such things.

188
00:14:59,971 --> 00:15:03,837
Yes, yes, let's stop arguing.

189
00:15:03,837 --> 00:15:05,065
Shut up.

190
00:15:05,065 --> 00:15:08,373
We will crush them in an instant.

191
00:15:08,373 --> 00:15:11,325
Waku Waku Space-Time activated.

192
00:15:17,390 --> 00:15:19,633
Waku Waku Space-Time?

193
00:15:21,777 --> 00:15:22,750
Look at that.

194
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:34,162
This is a prototype of the King Squasher
that we have revived thanks to the power
accumulated from many warriors.

195
00:15:34,162 --> 00:15:36,233
This is the prototype of Queen Sideron.

196
00:15:36,818 --> 00:15:39,282
This will take them out.

197
00:15:39,282 --> 00:15:41,670
Prototype King Squasher.

198
00:15:41,670 --> 00:15:43,801
Prototype Queen Sideron.

199
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:49,870
The problem is that we've used
our power in all the fights
and incidents during the journey.

200
00:15:49,870 --> 00:15:52,989
Now we're in danger.

201
00:15:52,989 --> 00:15:54,597
We have to...

202
00:15:56,338 --> 00:15:57,827
—Defeat them.

203
00:16:07,853 --> 00:16:11,129
The power of hundreds of warriors we've gathered so far.

204
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:14,495
It will serve to crush both of them.

205
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:16,153
Die!

206
00:16:32,213 --> 00:16:37,275
Damn, it's useless without King Squasher.

207
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,565
That's right. I don't have Queen Sideron either.

208
00:16:48,784 --> 00:16:51,369
Ready, mya. —My dear.

209
00:16:54,315 --> 00:16:55,968
Lamunes. —Tama Q.

210
00:16:55,968 --> 00:16:58,500
Darling —Hebi Metaco.

211
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,846
With you, Tama Q, we'll win.

212
00:17:01,846 --> 00:17:03,178
Let's go, Tama Q.

213
00:17:03,178 --> 00:17:04,777
OK, mya.

214
00:17:10,085 --> 00:17:13,537
OK, Heavy Metaco, us too.

215
00:17:20,122 --> 00:17:21,468
Heavy Metaco.

216
00:17:24,322 --> 00:17:26,323
King Squasher.

217
00:17:26,323 --> 00:17:28,155
Queen Sideron.

218
00:17:48,533 --> 00:17:49,795
Let's go.

219
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,951
Let's go.

220
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:08,999
Let's go.

221
00:18:08,999 --> 00:18:12,155
I will.

222
00:18:20,896 --> 00:18:21,833
Lamunes.

223
00:18:21,833 --> 00:18:23,074
Da Cider.

224
00:18:25,625 --> 00:18:29,537
Tama Q, what the heck is a prototype King Squasher?

225
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:37,017
I once heard that in ancient times
there was a military protectorate...
and they created experimental prototypes.

226
00:18:37,017 --> 00:18:42,940
Those must have been the prototypes
for King Squasher and Queen Sideron.

227
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,728
They have the same power as ours, mya.

228
00:18:47,570 --> 00:18:51,905
The only thing left to do is
to rely on the skill of the pilot.

229
00:18:51,905 --> 00:18:54,143
Then victory will belong to my dear.

230
00:18:54,878 --> 00:18:56,433
Shut up.

231
00:18:56,433 --> 00:19:00,047
There's a way to prove it.

232
00:19:54,921 --> 00:19:59,146
Royal Straight Flush.

233
00:20:00,918 --> 00:20:03,653
Da Cider, let's use the Royal Scratch.

234
00:20:03,653 --> 00:20:04,816
OK.

235
00:20:04,816 --> 00:20:11,320
I'm burning fiercely now.

236
00:20:16,099 --> 00:20:19,795
Switching to Samurai On mode.

237
00:20:42,153 --> 00:20:44,673
In that case, I have to...

238
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:49,884
Yay! Da Cider, you're a simpleton.

239
00:20:49,884 --> 00:20:52,317
You look like a child.

240
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:54,802
You're an idiot!

241
00:20:54,802 --> 00:20:56,954
Nerd, clumsy, weirdo.

242
00:20:56,954 --> 00:21:01,750
Come on... Your word games are boring.

243
00:21:01,750 --> 00:21:04,610
Fool, imbecile...

244
00:21:06,813 --> 00:21:10,190
What do you say, bastards?

245
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,500
Go to hell.

246
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:18,945
Panther Mode activated.

247
00:21:39,825 --> 00:21:43,465
Royal Scratch.

248
00:21:56,263 --> 00:21:57,706
Shit, what happened?

249
00:21:57,706 --> 00:22:01,893
They are absorbing the power of the three sacred sisters, mya.

250
00:22:03,163 --> 00:22:05,925
Then I have to rescue Miruku.

251
00:22:05,925 --> 00:22:08,360
That's right, mya.

252
00:22:11,604 --> 00:22:12,931
Damn it.

253
00:22:16,264 --> 00:22:17,379
Lamunes.

254
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:18,549
Da Cider.

255
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:25,384
What was that?

256
00:22:25,384 --> 00:22:28,100
The Giant Ship 320 Rocket Ho.

257
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,064
Princesses.

258
00:22:29,064 --> 00:22:31,667
We've come to the rescue.

259
00:22:31,667 --> 00:22:33,348
Seyrom, Assam.

260
00:22:33,394 --> 00:22:35,630
Please, leave it to us.

261
00:22:35,630 --> 00:22:37,245
Danger, stand back.

262
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,979
What is this?

263
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:45,282
Why do you think you can just leave?

264
00:22:45,282 --> 00:22:46,953
We'll send you to the other world.

265
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,260
Now!

266
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:56,226
I'll rescue Leska.

267
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:08,732
That's what you get for boasting.

268
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:10,776
Sister, the power isn't enough.

269
00:23:12,364 --> 00:23:14,596
¿Do you think we'll let them go?

270
00:23:14,596 --> 00:23:17,991
Royal Straight Flush.

271
00:23:20,854 --> 00:23:22,290
We have trouble, Mya.

272
00:23:22,290 --> 00:23:24,864
Tama Q, please take charge for a moment.

273
00:23:24,864 --> 00:23:26,933
Hebi Metako, take charge too.

274
00:23:26,933 --> 00:23:29,369
Wait, darling.

275
00:23:30,678 --> 00:23:31,697
Lamunes.

276
00:23:31,697 --> 00:23:32,897
Da Cider.

277
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:49,431
Miruku, are you okay?

278
00:23:49,431 --> 00:23:50,984
Because you've done something so dangerous.

279
00:23:50,984 --> 00:23:52,868
Hello, Leska.

280
00:23:52,868 --> 00:23:55,069
Don't play dumb; you didn't have to worry about me.

281
00:23:55,994 --> 00:23:58,639
Lamunes, I can't hold on any longer.

282
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,980
Honey, quickly.

283
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:07,308
Cocoa is still sleeping.

284
00:24:07,308 --> 00:24:09,313
Hold on, Miruku.

285
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:11,330
As you say, Lamunes.

286
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:12,506
OK.

287
00:24:12,506 --> 00:24:13,946
Hey, Leska.

288
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,834
Tell me, Da Cider.

289
00:24:15,834 --> 00:24:18,367
Have you gained weight?

290
00:24:19,527 --> 00:24:23,190
Don't be reckless.

291
00:24:23,163 --> 00:24:24,878
Lamunes —Honey.

292
00:24:25,328 --> 00:24:27,048
We only have one chance.

293
00:24:27,048 --> 00:24:29,052
Get ready for the jump.

294
00:24:29,052 --> 00:24:30,035
OK.

295
00:24:39,308 --> 00:24:41,835
Royal Scratch.

296
00:24:50,761 --> 00:24:54,083
Sister, power is not enough.

297
00:24:54,083 --> 00:24:58,018
What happened to the power of the three sacred sisters?

298
00:25:35,343 --> 00:25:37,102
We've put an end to that conspiracy.

299
00:25:37,102 --> 00:25:40,542
Our mission is complete, Lamunes.

300
00:25:47,417 --> 00:25:49,661
I slept so well.

301
00:25:54,396 --> 00:25:56,633
My glasses.

302
00:25:58,047 --> 00:26:00,039
Cocoa, you're finally opening your eyes.

303
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,456
Hey, you guys.

304
00:26:03,212 --> 00:26:04,970
What have you done!

305
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:07,612
You've even destroyed the Puff Puff Palace.

306
00:26:07,612 --> 00:26:10,234
Oh, those girls are still alive!

307
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:11,182
How resistant.

308
00:26:11,182 --> 00:26:13,993
We can't forgive them.

309
00:26:13,993 --> 00:26:15,814
We're going to kill those beasts.

310
00:26:20,186 --> 00:26:22,650
Cursed ones, this won't be forgotten.

311
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,844
We'll get our revenge next time.

312
00:26:25,844 --> 00:26:30,501
The last time-space stone still remained.

313
00:26:30,501 --> 00:26:34,047
It seems they have reconciled.

314
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:37,015
Have you received your punishment?

315
00:26:37,015 --> 00:26:39,810
Ah, I remembered.

316
00:26:39,810 --> 00:26:42,196
You've been deceiving us from the start.

317
00:26:42,196 --> 00:26:44,282
No, I mean...

318
00:26:44,282 --> 00:26:46,382
Well, you see...

319
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:49,004
I'll punish you. —I'll punish you.

320
00:26:53,376 --> 00:26:55,099
I hope they learn their lesson. —They'll learn.

321
00:26:58,602 --> 00:26:59,891
There won't be a second time.

322
00:26:59,891 --> 00:27:02,003
It won't happen again.

323
00:27:02,764 --> 00:27:03,755
No objections.

324
00:27:04,725 --> 00:27:10,009
Okay, okay, I'll call the Arara Castle and ask them to pick us up.

325
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:11,943
Ara-ra.

326
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:16,095
I am Princess Lyria of the Muchi Muchi Kingdom.

327
00:27:16,095 --> 00:27:20,366
Now we need strong warriors in our kingdom.

328
00:27:20,366 --> 00:27:26,404
I'll reward you with the best I have.

329
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:28,859
I'll be waiting.

330
00:27:29,907 --> 00:27:30,902
Da Cider.

331
00:27:30,902 --> 00:27:31,648
Lamunes.

332
00:27:32,785 --> 00:27:35,976
Let's go to the Muchi Muchi Kingdom...

333
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:40,331
What are you doing? You haven't learned your lesson at all.

334
00:27:40,331 --> 00:27:42,049
Ara ara.

335
00:27:42,384 --> 00:27:44,314
Ara?

336
00:27:44,539 --> 00:27:50,250

Unreleased version from the year 2023.

00:00:14,831 --> 00:00:20,269
Translation, subtitles, timing, and correction: Ander Innervideo.

3
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,865
It looks like Cocoa,
I can do it.

4
00:00:40,959 --> 00:00:43,858
I'll leave it like that.

5
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:52,858
What could it have been?

6
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:53,858
Hello!

7
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,006
Waaa!

8
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:57,760
You!

9
00:00:58,100 --> 00:00:59,956
Long time no see, Lamunes.

10
00:01:00,426 --> 00:01:02,748
Da Cider, why do you appear so suddenly?

11
00:01:02,826 --> 00:01:05,882
Wait, I just came to annoy you for a moment.

12
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:08,693
I hope I'm not causing any trouble.

13
00:01:13,826 --> 00:01:18,991
Has something happened in the Hara Hara world?

14
00:01:19,126 --> 00:01:22,011
Actually, there's something I want to show you.

15
00:01:24,126 --> 00:01:27,748
What is this?

16
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:36,325
I am Gold Mountain.

17
00:01:36,726 --> 00:01:38,948
I am Silver Mountain.

18
00:01:40,906 --> 00:01:43,958
We are the Mountain Dew sisters.

19
00:01:44,126 --> 00:01:46,900
Wow, how cute!

20
00:01:47,126 --> 00:01:50,300
Thanks to the warriors for receiving this message.

21
00:01:50,526 --> 00:01:54,300
We beg you to please help us.

22
00:01:54,626 --> 00:01:55,139
What?

23
00:01:55,426 --> 00:02:01,748
Our mission is to keep an ancient evil sealed.

24
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:05,348
But our power is not enough.

25
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:10,348
Therefore, we seek powerful people
to help us in this mission.

26
00:02:10,406 --> 00:02:10,848
What?

27
00:02:11,926 --> 00:02:15,548
In return, you will be rewarded.

28
00:02:15,626 --> 00:02:19,748
We are willing to please you as much as we can.

29
00:02:20,126 --> 00:02:22,148
What?

30
00:02:30,126 --> 00:02:32,148
What!?

31
00:02:32,126 --> 00:02:38,008
Please, come and help us at the Puff Puff Palace.

32
00:02:39,126 --> 00:02:42,008
We won't disappoint you.

33
00:02:42,126 --> 00:02:44,848
Da-da-da Cider, what does this mean?

34
00:02:45,126 --> 00:02:50,248
I had a lot of difficulties (fights)
to get this strange crystal orb.

35
00:02:50,426 --> 00:02:55,048
Da Cider, why exactly are you showing me this?

36
00:02:55,126 --> 00:02:57,098
Well, keep watching.

37
00:02:57,526 --> 00:03:03,098
Please, all the warriors
come when you hear our call.

38
00:03:03,526 --> 00:03:07,498
We need each warrior.

39
00:03:08,226 --> 00:03:10,098
To each...?

40
00:03:10,226 --> 00:03:11,519
I am Gold.

41
00:03:11,726 --> 00:03:13,919
I am Silver.

42
00:03:14,726 --> 00:03:25,919
We need two perfect warriors; we will be
at the Puff Puff Palace in the Ura Ura Valley.

43
00:03:29,526 --> 00:03:35,919
Da Cider, we have to go and help them!
Aren't we men?

44
00:03:35,926 --> 00:03:37,519
That's the spirit, Lamunes.

45
00:03:38,926 --> 00:03:43,019
I'm feeling that...

46
00:03:43,226 --> 00:03:45,719
...I'm burning with excitement.

47
00:03:45,926 --> 00:03:50,119
Alright, we have to leave.

48
00:03:50,226 --> 00:03:54,119
Let's go!

49
00:04:09,802 --> 00:04:14,653
NG Knight Ramune and 40 DX.

50
00:04:15,987 --> 00:04:19,089
Saying goodbye is difficult after all.

51
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:22,212
A smile is the best thing you can give!

52
00:04:22,212 --> 00:04:25,243
Don't let that affect you.

53
00:04:25,243 --> 00:04:27,609
I will keep moving forward.

54
00:04:27,609 --> 00:04:33,790
I don't know what tomorrow will bring.

55
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:37,095
The path of loneliness.

56
00:04:37,095 --> 00:04:40,776
Is the fate of the hero.

57
00:04:40,776 --> 00:04:43,882
Welcome, high school girls (high school girls!)

58
00:04:43,882 --> 00:04:47,020
Welcome, college girls (college girls!)

59
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:49,991
Towards the East, West, North, South, right, and left! (Let's go!)

60
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:54,764
Please wait for my arrival.

61
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:13,295
If this world is a big game.

62
00:05:13,295 --> 00:05:16,406
I promise you a happy ending.

63
00:05:16,406 --> 00:05:19,474
If your level is low.

64
00:05:19,474 --> 00:05:21,826
Don't worry about it.

65
00:05:21,826 --> 00:05:27,769
Our romance from our past lives wasn't bad either.

66
00:05:27,769 --> 00:05:31,362
One life at a time.

67
00:05:31,362 --> 00:05:34,954
Or they will accumulate.

68
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:38,046
You look impressive, my lady (my lady!)

69
00:05:38,046 --> 00:05:41,104
Like a office lady too (OL too!)

70
00:05:41,104 --> 00:05:44,223
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, even Friday (even Friday!)

71
00:05:44,223 --> 00:05:49,520
I will fight 24 hours.

72
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:19,859
Be careful with the double reserve! (Be careful!)

73
00:06:19,859 --> 00:06:22,949
If you fail, I'll see my blood run (I'll see blood!)

74
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,128
Toward the East, West, North, South, right, and left! (We'll win!)

75
00:06:26,128 --> 00:06:31,405
My youth is my sin.

76
00:06:57,526 --> 00:07:00,319
Exciting space-time, blazing battle.

77
00:07:00,426 --> 00:07:03,272
A new journey, warriors of love.

78
00:07:08,011 --> 00:07:10,919
You haven't seen anything.

79
00:07:12,781 --> 00:07:17,656
Don't feel bad, but you'll be an obstacle 
to our important mission.

80
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,537
Oooe! Tama Q.

81
00:07:23,011 --> 00:07:24,931
Lamunes, what are you doing here da-mya?

82
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:29,273
Oh! I heard that your child was born.

83
00:07:29,611 --> 00:07:31,273
She is the youngest of my daughters da-mya.

84
00:07:31,711 --> 00:07:33,000
Daughters?

85
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:37,000
What's going on? Who is he?
Papa, papa.

86
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,580
Wow... you look very busy.

87
00:07:41,911 --> 00:07:44,570
What's the reason for your visit da-mya?

88
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:52,580
We're passing through with Da Cider,
but we want to go unnoticed.
I want you to come with me.

89
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:56,580
Has something happened da-mya?

90
00:07:58,711 --> 00:08:00,057
Papa, is he Lamunes?

91
00:08:00,061 --> 00:08:00,924
The one from the legend...

92
00:08:01,042 --> 00:08:03,580
The hero who committed so many blunders?

93
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,780
What are they saying?

94
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:09,110
I can't go, mya.

95
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,110
Why not, Tama Q?

96
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:18,110
I have a family now, da-mya,
and I can't leave without a reason, mya.

97
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:22,510
Don't tell me no; you have to come.

98
00:08:22,711 --> 00:08:30,510
Don't take our papa away.
—Let him go. —We won't allow it.

99
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:34,210
Ah, alright, alright.

100
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:36,210
What are we going to do, Da Cider?

101
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,287
Well, I guess we have to go alone.

102
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:43,555
But we don't have transportation.

103
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,888
That's not a problem.

104
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,492
Ahhh...
What was that?

105
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,808
What was all that?
I think I'm hungry.

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,692
Thief, thief!

107
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:10,692
Don't take my money.

108
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,592
That engine sound...

109
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:21,092
By any chance...

110
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:25,056
The engine is in good condition.

111
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,756
Let the takeoff of the aluminum whale begin.

112
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,156
Why are they taking it away?

113
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,456
Who the hell dares to rob us?

114
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:54,656
That's strange. It doesn't look like it was forced open.

115
00:09:57,429 --> 00:09:59,999
Hebi Metaco.
Note: A pun between serpiente (hebi) and Heavy Metal.

116
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:02,239
Who did this to you?

117
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:05,399
My dear, my dear did this.

118
00:10:05,729 --> 00:10:07,549
Da Cider did?

119
00:10:07,729 --> 00:10:09,619
He did it along with Lamunes.

120
00:10:09,729 --> 00:10:12,315
Lamunes, why would Lamunes do that?

121
00:10:12,729 --> 00:10:13,515
It's because of this.

122
00:10:15,529 --> 00:10:21,315
Please, we are at the Puff Puff Palace.
Come help us.

123
00:10:22,429 --> 00:10:25,991
We won't disappoint you.

124
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:28,953
What does this mean?

125
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:33,159
Lamunes, this might be a very difficult journey.

126
00:10:34,083 --> 00:10:37,859
Remember, we have to keep it a secret,
especially from those two.

127
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,859
You can count on me; not a word will come from me.

128
00:10:41,383 --> 00:10:43,959
Alright, one last farewell to Castle Arara.

129
00:10:55,083 --> 00:11:01,859
The aluminum whale moves at full speed
towards the Ura Ura Valley.

130
00:11:02,083 --> 00:11:05,251
Let's go. —I feel full of energy and eager.

131
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,859
What's wrong with those two?

132
00:11:09,083 --> 00:11:12,859
Then they're going to see those two.

133
00:11:13,083 --> 00:11:14,319
Doesn't it seem too strange?

134
00:11:16,173 --> 00:11:19,859
I won't forgive you, you'll see what I have for you.

135
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:22,159
I have a sweet surprise for him too.

136
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:24,559
You won't escape.

137
00:11:24,573 --> 00:11:26,159
Let's chase them.

138
00:11:26,983 --> 00:11:29,159
The two of them could take it easy.

139
00:11:29,903 --> 00:11:30,759
Let's go.

140
00:11:34,383 --> 00:11:40,159
Let go of me...
I don't want to leave my family, da-mya.

141
00:11:40,283 --> 00:11:43,859
Papa, papa, bring our father back.

142
00:11:44,083 --> 00:11:46,159
Stop making so much noise!

143
00:11:47,883 --> 00:11:51,659
Miruku, my children are not at fault.

144
00:11:57,383 --> 00:11:59,959
Seyrom. —Assam.

145
00:12:01,383 --> 00:12:03,350
Teacup.

146
00:12:05,593 --> 00:12:06,941
Sweet wine.

147
00:12:07,683 --> 00:12:11,359
Princesses at your service.

148
00:12:11,668 --> 00:12:13,259
Are you in danger?

149
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:17,593
Hurry, we need some horses
—To make a carriage.

150
00:12:18,183 --> 00:12:21,034
Ah! How come?

151
00:12:27,083 --> 00:12:34,159
But we are guardian warriors;
however, they use us for anything,
as if we were chopsticks.

152
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:38,759
I'm sorry, guys, but we wouldn't do it
if it weren't urgent. Excuse us.

153
00:12:38,883 --> 00:12:41,059
Well, I know you mean it from the heart.

154
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,059
What are you saying?

155
00:12:42,383 --> 00:12:47,759
Okay, okay. Then direct the Giant Ship 320
at full speed to the castle's exit.

156
00:12:53,383 --> 00:12:54,959
I'm going to get my revenge, Lamunes.

157
00:12:55,083 --> 00:12:57,976
Da Cider, you'll see what I'll do
when I catch you.

158
00:13:08,013 --> 00:13:14,182
The dawn light floods my eyes,
bright eyes like the sunlight.

159
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:18,111
Gold-chan and Silver-chan are waiting for me.

160
00:13:19,213 --> 00:13:21,102
What's wrong with you?

161
00:13:21,213 --> 00:13:25,827
Have you not heard the wonderful wordplay
I just said?
Note: Da Cider is addicted to creating puns.

162
00:13:26,643 --> 00:13:28,550
Which words are you talking about?

163
00:13:28,613 --> 00:13:33,850
I'll tell you again,
so listen closely!

164
00:13:34,013 --> 00:13:38,105
Alright, Da Cider, but can I drive too?

165
00:13:38,819 --> 00:13:41,263
What are you saying? Of course not!
Look over there.

166
00:13:43,339 --> 00:13:48,105
Except for me, there is no man
who can steer that helm.

167
00:13:48,513 --> 00:13:50,105
Ha! I can do it too.

168
00:13:50,513 --> 00:13:51,694
Don't go near the helm again.

169
00:13:52,913 --> 00:13:55,911
You always cause the conflicts between the two.

170
00:13:56,413 --> 00:13:57,814
What did you say?

171
00:13:59,193 --> 00:13:59,905
What's wrong with you?

172
00:14:00,043 --> 00:14:05,905
It's always your fault, because of your stupidity.
—What are you saying? It's all your fault.

173
00:14:06,043 --> 00:14:10,229
Do you think I'm scared of you?
$&%$#$, &%4%&, $&%$#$.

174
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:17,370
Move aside, Lamunes.

175
00:14:17,443 --> 00:14:18,670
You do it.

176
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:42,155
What have you done, what have you done!
—I could say the same to you.

177
00:14:42,776 --> 00:14:46,705
You started it all.
—But it was your fault.

178
00:14:47,643 --> 00:14:48,368
What are you saying?

179
00:14:48,369 --> 00:14:50,137
Do you want to fight or what?

180
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:57,155
Hey, you two, wait a moment.
Does this path lead to the Ura Ura Valley?

181
00:14:57,343 --> 00:14:59,193
Well, you see...

182
00:14:59,543 --> 00:15:02,355
Brother, we're definitely lost.

183
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:08,255
Remember, we have to leave.
We can't let others get there first.

184
00:15:10,962 --> 00:15:11,660
This can't be.

185
00:15:12,943 --> 00:15:14,255
Those two...

186
00:15:14,543 --> 00:15:19,814
Everything will be fine, brother.
Gold-chan and Silver-chan are waiting for us.

187
00:15:20,543 --> 00:15:23,740
Oh, you're right, there's nothing to worry about.

188
00:15:23,753 --> 00:15:30,555
There's no one in the world who can defeat us.

189
00:15:33,543 --> 00:15:38,255
I see, we're not the only ones
going to the Puff Puff Palace.

190
00:15:38,443 --> 00:15:40,330
That means we'll have company.

191
00:15:40,443 --> 00:15:44,255
Ha, they're still waiting.

192
00:15:44,543 --> 00:15:45,555
Let's go!

193
00:15:48,259 --> 00:15:49,834
We'll have to leave in this.

194
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:52,034
Um, what is this?

195
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:57,316
It's a famous relic.
The Sky Propulsion Dragon!

196
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:01,516
Full speed ahead!

197
00:16:09,319 --> 00:16:14,116
How beautiful it is to travel in the open air.

198
00:16:16,719 --> 00:16:20,692
You're right.

199
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,725
What a beautiful journey.

200
00:16:25,810 --> 00:16:26,925
Agreed.

201
00:16:31,016 --> 00:16:31,819
Let's take a break.

202
00:16:31,935 --> 00:16:32,819
Agreed.

203
00:16:38,018 --> 00:16:39,445
We need to go faster.

204
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:42,445
Yes, we can't waste any more time.

205
00:16:49,548 --> 00:16:52,499
Hey, you two.

206
00:16:53,015 --> 00:16:54,245
What's going on?

207
00:16:54,918 --> 00:17:01,445
Men who dare to mistreat a lovely maiden
and set their eyes on others.
I swear we won't forgive them.

208
00:17:01,858 --> 00:17:03,205
Who are you?

209
00:17:03,868 --> 00:17:07,205
I am a beautiful warrior of royalty, fighting
for love and justice.

210
00:17:07,368 --> 00:17:09,205
Seinaru Miruki.

211
00:17:10,068 --> 00:17:12,880
I am Seinaru Lemon.

212
00:17:13,248 --> 00:17:18,200
I am Seinaru Cacao.

213
00:17:19,248 --> 00:17:21,200
I am Luna Metaco.

214
00:17:24,548 --> 00:17:26,800
How lovely!

215
00:17:29,748 --> 00:17:31,500
What kind of strategy is this, da-mya?

216
00:17:33,248 --> 00:17:36,500
Seinaru Miruki will punish them.

217
00:17:39,982 --> 00:17:41,768
What are you two doing here?

218
00:17:41,888 --> 00:17:43,880
Look at me when I'm talking to you.

219
00:17:45,703 --> 00:17:49,960
Wait a moment, why are you angry?

220
00:17:49,999 --> 00:17:52,186
Ask yourself that.

221
00:17:54,700 --> 00:18:03,938
You have abandoned your girl for another woman
and hurt the heart of that lovely girl.

222
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:05,080
I don't remember.

223
00:18:05,499 --> 00:18:07,010
What did you say?

224
00:18:07,993 --> 00:18:10,500
Now that you mention it, Seinaru Miruki.

225
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:11,322
What?

226
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:17,450
Please, give me your address and phone number.

227
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,150
Miruki punch.

228
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:29,250
Why don't you behave as you should?

229
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,901
What are you doing?

230
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,350
What?

231
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:55,342
A bit more...

232
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:57,274
I hope the wind blows strongly.

233
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,114
Damned.

234
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:10,614
Mikuri kick.

235
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:16,414
Lemon punch loop.

236
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:21,214
Miserable.

237
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:24,900
I didn't think they'd have the guts to come this far.

238
00:19:27,623 --> 00:19:33,470
They have lost their minds, Lamunes.

239
00:19:35,253 --> 00:19:37,670
We should go.

240
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:39,670
Let's go!

241
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,670
Where do you think you're going?

242
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:48,670
You won't escape.

243
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,170
Hurry up, sister.

244
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:56,770
Wait, please.

245
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:03,100
Yahoo! What speed.

246
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:04,574
Lamunes, look over there.

247
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,120
Clear the way!

248
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,485
It's those guys.

249
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:19,271
Brother, it's the two from before.

250
00:20:20,218 --> 00:20:22,995
How could I forget them.

251
00:20:25,018 --> 00:20:26,195
Where did all of them come from?

252
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:31,333
We need to get to the Puff Puff Palace.

253
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,953
Gold-chan is mine.

254
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:36,683
Silver-chan is mine.

255
00:20:37,127 --> 00:20:38,983
There are too many rivals.

256
00:20:39,827 --> 00:20:42,493
Idiots. - Stop. - Fools...

257
00:20:42,527 --> 00:20:47,000
Keep going, don't stop.

258
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,613
If you stop, you'll regret it.

259
00:20:53,706 --> 00:20:57,338
Da Cider, we'll have to fight.

260
00:20:57,858 --> 00:20:59,338
What did you say?

261
00:20:59,658 --> 00:21:01,700
Eat this.

262
00:21:07,928 --> 00:21:10,400
Damn, how did that feel?

263
00:21:12,988 --> 00:21:15,600
Hey, you guys, we're still here.

264
00:21:19,088 --> 00:21:20,500
Lamunes, why don't you do something?

265
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:22,500
Why don't you do it?

266
00:21:24,348 --> 00:21:25,619
They're as good as dead.

267
00:21:36,488 --> 00:21:38,200
We did it.

268
00:21:38,488 --> 00:21:40,650
They have experienced our power.

269
00:21:41,488 --> 00:21:43,912
Now, we are the only ones left.

270
00:21:43,999 --> 00:21:47,508
Indeed, everything went according to my plan.

271
00:21:48,368 --> 00:21:50,300
Lamunes, look.

272
00:22:04,768 --> 00:22:09,700
Idiot, why didn't you see it earlier?

273
00:22:09,768 --> 00:22:13,229
You always blame me for the bad things.

274
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:18,736
You need to be in sync with your partner.

275
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,600
Why are you saying that?

276
00:22:23,118 --> 00:22:24,400
Because you're a baby.

277
00:22:24,915 --> 00:22:26,592
Do you want to fight?

278
00:22:26,600 --> 00:22:28,402
Then let's fight.

279
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:33,686
I am Gold Mountain.

280
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:36,317
I am Silver Mountain.

281
00:22:38,363 --> 00:22:43,867
Please, we'll be waiting for you...
at the Puff Puff Palace, please.

282
00:22:44,394 --> 00:22:45,767
Da Cider.

283
00:22:46,994 --> 00:22:48,072
Lamunes.

284
00:22:48,818 --> 00:22:52,020
Gold-chan and Silver-chan are waiting for us.

285
00:22:52,494 --> 00:22:54,705
Let's set aside our differences.

286
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,750
Let's go!

287
00:23:15,013 --> 00:23:16,600
Great father of chaos.

288
00:23:16,813 --> 00:23:19,619
I beg you to wait a little longer.

289
00:23:19,913 --> 00:23:22,400
We are gathering the souls of powerful warriors.

290
00:23:22,983 --> 00:23:29,400
Together with my sister, we will help you
fulfill your dreams.

291
00:23:29,913 --> 00:23:33,635
Ah, sister, it's only a matter of time.

292
00:23:36,313 --> 00:23:40,666
This world will be ours.

293
00:23:58,993 --> 00:24:01,269
Do we have to climb this way?

294
00:24:01,593 --> 00:24:03,136
We have to find another path.

295
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:09,525
Be careful.

296
00:24:09,633 --> 00:24:12,553
I know...

297
00:24:18,026 --> 00:24:19,421
Are you okay?

298
00:24:24,026 --> 00:24:25,177
Thank you for saving me.

299
00:24:25,626 --> 00:24:27,721
There's no need to say that.

300
00:24:27,726 --> 00:24:29,821
We are companions.

301
00:24:32,426 --> 00:24:33,721
Let's do our best.

302
00:24:33,826 --> 00:24:35,921
We've been waiting for you.

303
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:40,700
Are you ready for your punishment?

304
00:24:41,326 --> 00:24:42,611
Wait a moment.

305
00:24:42,726 --> 00:24:44,881
Don't say anything.

306
00:24:53,226 --> 00:24:54,781
Stay still.

307
00:25:03,226 --> 00:25:04,781
What an amazing attack.

308
00:25:04,826 --> 00:25:06,981
Such impressive light effects, da-mya.

309
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:10,981
These rocks aren't supposed to explode, right?

310
00:25:13,910 --> 00:25:17,171
What kind of stones are these? Maybe...

311
00:25:19,610 --> 00:25:24,371
Wait, wait, why are you behaving like this towards us?

312
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:27,871
Why don't you guess what you've done wrong?

313
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,471
What have we done wrong?

314
00:25:30,910 --> 00:25:35,871
We are heroes, and we are rescuing some maidens.
Is it wrong to save them?

315
00:25:35,910 --> 00:25:38,508
We won't forgive you.

316
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,233
Please wait, this place is a time-space bomb,
it will trigger a chain explosion.

317
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:48,233
If you exceed the friction point,
it will cause unexpected effects.

318
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,333
We don't care.

319
00:25:50,810 --> 00:25:55,753
This area is surrounded by those rocks...
they could cause alterations to the time-space.

320
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,233
They have evaporated.

321
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:21,162
Where could they have gone, da-mya?

322
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:35,072
What happened here?

323
00:26:35,074 --> 00:26:35,700
Where are we?

324
00:26:36,514 --> 00:26:39,400
We were supposed to be in the
cave of the Ura Ura Valley.

325
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,221
I wonder where we ended up.

326
00:26:46,174 --> 00:26:47,272
It's the castle of Arara.

327
00:26:47,714 --> 00:26:50,621
I wonder what went wrong?

328
00:26:50,635 --> 00:26:53,621
Wait a moment, something strange is happening.

329
00:26:58,635 --> 00:27:00,530
This can't be!

330
00:27:06,435 --> 00:27:09,430
Good, keep it up...

331
00:27:11,635 --> 00:27:14,000
The Arara Castle will be ours.

332
00:27:17,017 --> 00:27:18,502
What is happening here?

333
00:27:18,635 --> 00:27:26,505
I am very confused, what is going on?

334
00:27:27,785 --> 00:27:33,092
Note: They have traveled through time-space,
right to the first episode of the first season (3 years ago),
where Da Cider and Leska were villains and enemies of Lamunes XD

NG Knight Ramune and 40 DX Ending 1 - Lullaby ☆ Dear

338
00:27:57,785 --> 00:28:05,554
What is the waistline for?, Why?

339
00:28:05,554 --> 00:28:12,768
Why is your arm long?, Why?

340
00:28:12,768 --> 00:28:20,291
Like when two people hug

341
00:28:20,291 --> 00:28:32,423
As if it were the law of love pulling the North Pole and the South Pole.

342
00:28:32,423 --> 00:28:36,262
GOOD NIGHT, my heart

343
00:28:36,262 --> 00:28:40,617
GOOD NIGHT, Good night

344
00:28:40,617 --> 00:28:47,807
Like a lullaby (Lullaby)

345
00:28:47,807 --> 00:28:51,631
GOOD NIGHT, before you fall asleep

346
00:28:51,631 --> 00:28:56,067
GOOD NIGHT, it's not just the outfit

347
00:28:56,067 --> 00:30:00,004
Touching naked hearts, ah, ah…
